# Development 

## The relationship between policy and technology

The development of a policy related open data standard may take place in a variety of different ways.

* **Policy -> Standard** - the standard is intended to support implementation of a policy framework that is already fixed. Creating the specification may require providing added specificity where the policy contains ambiguity, or may require faithfully representing the policy, even the gaps it contains. 

* **Parallel development** - the standard and the policy are co-developed, feeding into each other. Sometimes the policy is embedded deeply within the technical specification: at other times 

* **Standard -> Policy** - the standard is created, and then policy set that references the standard, or requires data is shared using it. 

### Action

What is the policy goal of this standard? Who is involved in setting policy? How is policy set and revised? 

### Examples

* **Policy -> Standard** The [EU Standard Forms for Public Procurement](http://simap.ted.europa.eu/standard-forms-for-public-procurement) support implementation of European Procurement Directives. The forms must include information specified for disclosure in the directives, and the forms cannot add new information requirements not covered in the directives.

* **Parallel development** Version 1.0 of the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org) provided a data model and a set of implementation levels used to assess the extent of data disclosure. A number of implementers made policy commitments to reach particular implementation levels.

* **Standard -> Policy** In some countries transparency advocates have pushed for adoption of OCDS, writing adoption of the standard into policy. 

## Mapping stakeholders


The development process for an open data standard needs to:

* [ ] Identify the stakeholders involved in data publication and use;
* [ ] Map user-needs
