## Getting started

This handbook is about policy-related open data standards. These cover both content (what to publish?) and representation (how to publish?). 

The handbook describes maintaining data specifications that can support the realization of policy goals. 

---
For example: 

A campaign calls for organizations to publish their pay ratios between men and women, and highest and lowest paid employees, in order to highlight and address pay inequality. This is the policy goal. 

A schema is developed and documented, describing how to publish CSV files on an organizations website that provide these figures. This is the data specification. 

Further documentation, data quality frameworks, and validation models are developed that can be used to check that the data provided using the specification is accessible, meaningful and actionable. Together with the specification, this constitutes the open data standard. 

The success or not of this policy related open data standard rests first on data availability and interoperability, and then on the data being usable, useful and ultimately put into use that can drive policy outcomes.

VERY DRAFT: 

It is important to make distinctions between

* **The data specification** that describes in technical detail how certain data should be represented if it is to be inter-operable; and
* **The data standard** which may also incorporate additional policy norms about the quality to which data should be provided.
