Standards Lab: an open data standard toolkit
============================================

This handbook provides an overview of the creation, maintenance and adoption of a policy-related open data standard. 

It has been developed by [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop) to document our approach as part of the [Open Data Institute](http://www.theodi.org) Open Standards for Data project as part of a program of work with Innovate UK, the UKâ€™s innovation agency. 

It is written as both a standalone guide, and also as template to create individual standard handbooks. 

## Overview

This guide is split into three sections.

* [Development and maintenance](development/index) covers the initiation, development, maintenance and revision of a standard;
* [Adoption](adoption/index) covers approaches to supporting adoption of an open data standard through engagement with data publishers, intermediaries and users;
* [Learning](learning/index) covers monitoring standard uptake and impact, and maintaining ongoing alignment with the overall policy goals of a standard.

        If you have a project that might involve open data standards, our Standards Lab service can help. Get in touch to find out more about:

        * **Introductory workshops** - exploring the basics of building, maintaining and implementing an open data standard. Ideal to bring together policy and technology teams, and develop shared understanding and strategy. 

        * **Mentoring and advice** - whatever stage your standards project is at, we can provide expert input on how to make it sustainable, and high impact. 

        * **Full service standard development and support** - working with you to go from concept, to a full standard - and to support implementation and ongoing development.
