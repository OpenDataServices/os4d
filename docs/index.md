Standards Lab: an open data standard toolkit
============================================

This handbook provides an overview of the creation, maintenance and adoption of a policy-related open data standard. 

It has been developed by [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop) to document our approach as part of the [Open Data Institute](tttp:/www.theodi.org) Open Standards for Data project. 

It is written as both a standalone guide, and also as template to create individual standard handbooks.
