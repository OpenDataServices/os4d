## Develop a glossary first

### Problem

Terms may be translated inconsistently, or technical translators may not select the right term of art. 

### Solution

Develop a glossary first, to include the key technical terms and terms-of-art used in the standard.

### Method

Write a concise description of each of these terms *in the context of the standard*. This can ensure terms are used consistently in the main language, and that translators have information to base their translations on.

```eval_rst
.. _pattern-separate-translation-review:
```
## Separate translation and review

### Problem

Mistakes in translation, or translations that make wrong assumptions about the audience, can cause a lot of confusion.

### Solution

Separate translation and review. Have the same reviewer for a language to ensure consistency.

.. todo::
  .. markdown::

    ### Method

    ### Example

    ### Related patterns

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`pattern-slug`; :ref:`pattern-slug-2`;
    ```

    :ref:`component-slug`; :ref:`component-slug-2`;
    ```

```eval_rst
.. _pattern-translation-feedback:
```
## Translation feedback

### Problem

Users may have questions or suggestions to improve a translation. 

### Solution

Provide tools to allow them to comment on the translated text. 

### Method

Tools like hypothes.is can support non-technical users (who wouldn't use GitHub) to annotate a schema. 


````eval_rst
.. todo::
  .. markdown::

    ### Example

    ### Related patterns

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`pattern-slug`; :ref:`pattern-slug-2`;
    ```

    ### Related components

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`component-slug`; :ref:`component-slug-2`;
    ```
````





---
```eval_rst
.. _pattern-translation-normative:
```
## Normative documentation

### Problem

Documentation may need to be improved. Improvements can be delayed if waiting for a new version

### Solution

Clearly separate normative and non-normative documentation so that updates can be made more easily. 


````eval_rst
.. todo::
  .. markdown::

    ### Method

    ### Example

    ### Related patterns

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`pattern-slug`; :ref:`pattern-slug-2`;
    ```

    ### Related components

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`component-slug`; :ref:`component-slug-2`;
    ```
````


---
```eval_rst
.. _pattern-translation-policy:
```
## Translation policy

### Problem

Users need to know the status of a translation

### Solution

Develop a clear policy and process for managing translations. Clearly indicate the authoritative language.


````eval_rst
.. todo::
  .. markdown::

    ### Method

    ### Example

    ### Related patterns

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`pattern-slug`; :ref:`pattern-slug-2`;
    ```

    ### Related components

    ```eval_rst
    :ref:`component-slug`; :ref:`component-slug-2`;
    ```
