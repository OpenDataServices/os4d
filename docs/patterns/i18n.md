## Schema design for a global audience

### Problem

Data structures may be based on local cultural assumptions, or known falsehoods.

### Solution

 There are a number of [lists of 'falsehoods programmers believe'](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) that provide a useful corrective to assumptions that might otherwise make it tricky to use data structures to represent names, addresses, locations or other information from particular parts of the world.

## Internationalise links in the schema

### Problem

Links from within schema field descriptions may point to only the English  docs.

### Solution

When linking to documentation from within schema field descriptions, use `{lang}` tokens, and replace these when compiling schemas and documentation, so that users are always linked to their own language versions of the documentation.

```
## Examples for a global audience

### Problem

Examples may be less relevant outside of the context they were originally written in.

### Solution

Consider the cultural relevance of the examples used in documentation, or explore whether examples can be generated using tools that support localisation.
