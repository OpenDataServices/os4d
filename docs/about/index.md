Open Data Services Co-operative was established in 2015 to support organisations to publish and use open data. We have a particular focus on incubating early stage open data standards, and supporting the development of effective transparency and collaboration initiatives using well-maintained open data standards. 

We often act as the technical partner to policy-focussed initiatives, working under contract to develop and maintain open data standards, and to support standard implementation.

Our team of employees and members work across a range of tasks:

* **Software development** - creating re-usable open source code that helps us to do our work, and that supports the documentation, implementation and demonstration of open data standards;
* **Analysis and implementation support** - working with policy initiatives, governments, non-profits and companies to equip them to publish and use open data with one of the standards we support;
* **Research and development** - supporting the development of new open data standards;
* **Training and consultancy** - addressing issues of policy and organisational change.

We operate as a non-hierarchical worker-owned business, committed to [co-operative principles and values](https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles), and to using our resources in order to provide a good place to work, to develop our staff, and to contribute to the wider community. 

We are primarily funded through short and long-term contracts to research, develop and support implementation of open data standards.
