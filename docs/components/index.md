=================

On reviewing a range of policy-related data standards, including those that we maintain and those maintained by others, we identified approximately 60 components that at least two standards have chosen to create or adopt.

Whether or not these are important to a particular standard depends on lots of factors, including but not limited to the maturity of the standard, whether the standard’s adoption is being driven co-operatively or adversarially, political factors and the character of the people and organisations in the domain where the standard operates.

We conducted an exercise with representatives of several standards, asking them to conduct a diamond ranking exercise of the components. Diamond ranking was chosen to allow a ‘fat middle’ while forcing a decision on the highest and lowest priority items. Participants were asked to consider a standard at different levels of maturity, using Charles Handy’s Second Curve model for describing maturity.

The list of components is below, with TODO: guidance as to what may make them more or less important for a particular standard.

## Components

### Advocacy Plan

#### Summary

Setting out steps to encourage organizations to adopt the standard.

#### Description

An advocacy plan provides the resources and sets out the steps that will be followed to encourage organisations to adopt a standard, as well as key arguments. It should be updated regularly as the standard matures and as the standard starts to have an impact.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* Where standards are being developed outside of the organisations that are expected to adopt the standard
* If there is a perceived cost to adopting a standard

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* Where a standard is emerging from consensus among the organisations that are expected to use it

#### Related Components

```eval_rst
.. _component-blog:
```

### Blog

#### Summary

Sharing stories of successful implementation.

#### Description

A blog that is regularly updated can provide updates to the community, resources for them to refer back to, and act as a 'shop window' for the standard, demonstrating that it is maintained and used.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* Where a wide audience is sought

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If there isn't the resource available to make regular updates.

```eval_rst
.. _component-brand-agreements:
```

### Brand Agreements

#### Summary

Setting out who is allowed to use the logo, and how implementers should describe their relationship to the standard.

#### Description

Standards that have developed a brand need to ensure that it is used in a way that benefits the community and the standard. This will likely include guidance as to when the logo can be used, how tools should describe themselves relative to the standard, and ensure that the brand is only used when relevant

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* When a standard is growing quickly
* There is a proliferation of tools and adopters, especially those who might use the name of the standard in their services.

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* Where there is a trusted community or less of a strong brand.

### Brand Guidance

#### Summary

Describing how to use the logo and how to talk about the standard

#### Description

Brand guidance sets out how to use the name, logo, look-and-feel and other identifying marks and conventions. The guidance helps a standard ensure that it isn't misrepresented, and that there is a clear distinction between the standard and those using it.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard uses the name of a related concept in its own name
* During phases of rapid growth with a proliferation

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If a standard has not developed a strong brand

```eval_rst
.. _component-case-studies:
```

### Case Studies

#### Summary

Accessible write-ups exploring adoption and impact through narrative stories for a general audience.

#### Description

Case studies give real-world examples of when use of a standard has enabled a particular impact, while giving space for frank discussion of the challenges faced. This helps to set expectations among potential adopters and encourages those currently going through adoption of a standard to be reassured that encountering challenges isn't exceptional.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* Where a standard is more mature and at least one useful real example exists that can be described
* Where a strong advocacy is required to encourage adoption
* Where a standard's value proposition is concerned with impact beyond the use of the data - such as social outcomes

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* Where no real stories exist
* Where the community around a standard already share details with each other

```

### Communications Plan

#### Summary

Setting out steps to get media coverage of the standard.

#### Description

A communications plan sets out the steps that are planned to encourage media coverage of the standard. Having a plan ensures that media opportunities are sought, and that representatives of the standard are well-equipped when taking advantage of opportunities. It can ensure that the standard is properly represented, setting expectations among potential users and beneficaries.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard is likely to be of interest to either general or specific media outlets
* If a standard is intended to have an impact outside of its adopters

.. _component-demonstration-applications:
```

### Demonstration Applications

#### Summary

Showcasing what can be done with data when it is published to a standard

#### Description

Demonstration applications are either real-world or contrived applications using standardised data to illustrate what the data could be used for. They can be used to demonstrate the advantages of using the standard at all, or using particular parts of the stardard.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* Where the value proposition of a standard is hard to articulate in words

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* Early in a standard's development, as demonstration applications are likely to be costly to develop
* Where the community around a standard are developing applications as part of their adoption of the standard

```eval_rst
.. _component-discourse-forum:
```

### Discourse Forum

#### Summary

An online space for community discussion of the standard, adoption and data use.

#### Description

An online space for community discussion of the standard, adoption and data use. By using a forum instead of other online communications mechanisms, a complete audit trail for decisions can be retained and referred to. Over time, forums can become a valuable resource for implementers, and provide rich content for support articles, FAQs and other resources.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* When a standard has multiple stakeholders who don't meet regularly in person
* More mature standards

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* When the community around a standard regularly meet in person

```eval_rst
.. _component-draft-commitments:
```

### Draft Commitments

#### Summary

Asking potential adopters to sign-up and give their support to the standard.

#### Description

Draft commitments are templates for adopters to copy or adapt before signing and making public. By providing a draft, a standard can ensure that adopters are aware of what they are expected to commit to at the start of the process, and by providing a path of least resistance to a high bar of adoption, a standard organisation can ensure that there is less risk of implementers crafting their own, lower, commitment to adoption.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard requires a relatively high level of commitment to be useful
* If a standard is targetting public sector organisations that are keen to formally launch commitments
* If a very early-stage standard requires commitment in principle before development begins

### Glossary

#### Summary

Providing clear definitions for all the terms of art used in a standard.

#### Description

A glossary provides an authoritative and unambiguous list of the terms and their definitions as used in a standard. The definitions may be different from some of those used by adopters, but ensure clarity when using the standard.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard is to be localised or translated

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard relates to unambiguously defined terms in a sector

```eval_rst
.. _component-guidance-documentation:
```

### Guidance Documentation

#### Summary

Non-normative guidance on how to share data using the standard.

#### Description

Standards typically comprise a detailed, technical definition of how to publish data. They are often the product of extensive work and research, and are designed to be reference documentation. However, adoption requires adopters to be guided through the process of adoption - helped to understand how to start, where to focus effort, and how to understand concepts. Guidance documentation takes adopters through the process of using the standard, building on real-world experience.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If the standard is large
* If the standard uses a representation of concepts that may be unfamiliar to adopters
* If early adopters encountered issues or misunderstandings

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard is small, and implementation guidance can be included in the standard

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard is being discussed across media (eg in print, online and in person)
* If the standard is being translated
* If the standard introduces concepts unfamiliar to typical adopters
* If the standard is being discussed across policy and technical boundaries

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard does not have a defined visual language
* If the standard only uses concepts that will be familiar to adopters

### Logo

#### Summary

A logo for the standard

#### Description

A logo helps to reinforce the brand of the standard, gives a visual cue for recognition in resources, and can be used (with permission) by adoptors to demonstrate their use of the standard

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If the standard will be used by a range of organisations
* If the standard is operating in an environment where it needs to be given legitimacy and authority

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard is emerging from a community and is mostly for the use of that community

#### Description

A recommended license can help to ensure that adopters give due consideration to licensing, as well as setting a high bar for adopters and encouraging intertia among the community using the standard.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If adopters are unlikely to consider licensing as part of their adoption process
* If adopters are likely to have concerns over how their data can be used

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the data that the standard relates to is already governed by a license restriction

```

### Microblogging

#### Summary

Twitter (or similar) For communicating with the public.

#### Description

Public microblogging services such as Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram allow a standard to communicate little and often, and to engage with their communities in a relateable way. Some open communities already have a strong presence on microblogging sites, so the friction for engagement is reduced.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If there is a community of potential adopters who already use a particular microblogging service

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the time, people or infrastructure required to make regular updates is not available

#### Description

A standard's website brings together the various component of a standard, giving a single place where the standard can be explained to different audiences, and will act as a place that adopters go to in order to discover resources.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If there are multiple resources relating to a standard
* If a standard is intended to be used by a wider community than those instigating it

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If a standard is intended to only be used for a particular community who are involved in creating it
* If a standard is part of a wider operation that has its own web presence

```eval_rst
.. _component-api-specification:
```

### API Specification

#### Summary

Describing how data should be accessed interactively.

#### Description

APIs allow developers to access data stored elsewhere without needing to obtain and process the whole data set themselves. This lowers the barriers to creating applications that use the data, and encourages use. An API specification sets out a standard way for API developers to present interfaces to the data, meaning that consuming applications are more portable between publishers and removing the design cost for any adopter wishing to publish via an API

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If applications may be portable between data providers using the standard
* If an adopter is considering building an API

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* Early stage standards
* If there is no consideration of APIs
* If applications are unlikely to be portable between data providers

#### Related Components

```eval_rst
.. _component-codelists:
```

### Codelists

#### Summary

Classifications used in the standard

#### Description

Codelists are lists of terms that are provided as part of a standard in order to ensure that values of fields where there are a limited range of options are properly limited in the data, and that concepts map correctly between datasets. For example, a codelist might specify currency codes, to avoid US Dollars being referred to as "$" in one data set and "USD" in another. Codelists can be open or closed - open codelists allow values to be added, while closed codelists do not permit additions

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If there are currencies, languages or other commonly enumerated concepts in the standard
* If there are data elements that would be rendered as 'pick one from the list' in a form

```

### Contributor Guidelines

#### Summary

Describing the practices and workflows for contributing to the standard or associated documentation.

#### Description

Contributor guidelines set out the expectations of external contributions to the standard or the tools that are provided to support adopters. They typically cover licensing, procedure for contributions to be reviewed, acknowledgement, and expectations around process. Contributions may include comments in forum threads or in emails as well as formal written contributions.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If there are individuals or organisations who are keen to contribute directly to the standard or tools
* If the standard is starting to draw extensively on the ideas and work of the community to develop

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard is being developed entirely by the organisation that maintains it with little external input

```eval_rst
.. _component-conversion-tools:
```

### Conversion Tools

#### Summary

Allowing conversion between serialization formats (e.g. CSV -> XML; JSON -> XLS)

#### Description

Data standards often use structured data formats such as JSON or XML to give more flexbility in modelling and to allow validation against schema. Typically, developers prefer to work with structured data formats as they are easier to work with in programs. However, JSON and XML aren't very human-friendly, and people working with data in many domains prefer to use flat representations of data such as CSV and XLSX spreadsheets, both for publishing and manipulating data. Conversion tools allow conversion between the formats, to allow the standard and developers to retain the benfits of a structured data format and users to continue to be able to engage with the data in a way that they're comfortable with.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If the standard uses a structured data format, while data publishers and/or users prefer flat representations.

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard uses a data format that is the same as both publishers and users prefer to use

```eval_rst
.. _component-email-list:
```

### Email List

#### Summary

Used to discuss the standard, or announce standard updates.

#### Description

Email lists are a widely-accessible and low-cost way for a group to hold discussions, and many email list providers offer a public archive service so that accountability is maintained. Standards often have a discussion list and a separate announcement list, so that members can choose how involved they want to be. The asynchronous nature of email lists allows users to be involved as regularly or infrequently as they prefer. However, some users are reticent to post to public email lists for fear of appearing foolish or having their words during their learning being recorded.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* In the early stages of a standard
* If a public archive of discussions is important
* If key people in the development of the standard are comfortable with public email lists

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If there is reticence among users about public email lists

```eval_rst
.. _component-data-aggregator:
```

### Data Aggregator

#### Summary

Providing access to all the data shared using the standard.

#### Description

Many standards consider one of the best arguments for standardisation is being able to give examples of applications that become possible when the entire data set can be taken as a whole. A data aggregator brings together some or all of the data being published to the standard and enables users to obtain it as a single data set, removing the first barrier to application development on top of the data set, and encouraging experimentation.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If enough sources of standardised data exist to be usefully aggregated
* If having access to the whole data set is meaningful

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the data cannot meaningfully be considered as a whole
* If there are few data sources available, or their use of the standard is divergent enough as to make the data incomparable

### Example Data

#### Summary

Auto-generated and manually created examples used in tutorials, and for testing the standard.

#### Description

Adopters of the standard and users of the data are often helped by seeing examples of what the data could look like. Example data can often give hints that might be missed by reading documentation, and can be used to set expectations of what data should look like.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If the standard is large or complicated
* If adopters or users are often misunderstanding the requirements of the standard or strugging to 'get it'

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If the standard is intentionally loose
* If the standard is rapidly changing
* If the standard does not have schema or a field model

### FAQs

#### Summary

Addressing frequently asked questions from publishers and users.

#### Description

FAQs cover common issues and questions that are asked, and can be used to shape implementers' thinking very early in their process, addressing misconceptions before too much work happens. They can also be a useful reference resource - common solutions to regular issues can be recorded in a single place.

#### Examples

#### Prioritisation Factors

* If a standard helpdesk has sufficient traffic to be able to identify common issues

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* If a standard wants to ensure that they are in contact with all implementers from an early stage

### Dashboard (data publication statistics)

#### Summary

A single location for accessing reports on the number of publishers, status of current publication, validation errors, coverage of key fields, use of extensions and other key facts.

#### Description

A dashboard helps to answer questions like:

* Who is publishing using the standard?
* How many publishers are using version 1.0 or 1.1?
* How many publishers are using this specific field?
* What values are used in this specific field?
* Which codelists are publishers using?
* Which are the most common validation errors?
* If we deprecate a particular field, which publishers will be affected?

#### Examples

* The [IATI Dashboard](http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/) fetches changed data on a nightly basis (based on data in the IATI registry) and builds a collection of statistical reports, as well as maintaining historical data to show change over time.

### Contact Relationship Management (CRM)

#### Summary

A Contact Relationship Management (CRM) system can be used to track the different actors engaging with a standard, including implementers, users and support providers.

#### Description

A CRM may be used for:

* **Outreach and engagement** - identifying potential standard adopters, users and champions, and keeping track of communication and engagement with them;
* **Knowledge management** - keeping track of communication with particular standard adopters; making sure technical support and policy engagement is joined up; and providing access to consistent technical support answers;
* **Time tracking** - to supported charging by helpdesk consultants, or to allow reporting on which adopters require the greatest investment of time and support;
* **Reporting** - to track progress towards key adoption metrics, and to measure key performance indicators for a helpdesk;

Useful CRM features for supporting a standard include:

* Contact profiles
* Task tracking
* Agile board
* E-mail integration or e-mail helpdesk
* Knowledge base


#### Examples

* The Open Contracting Data Standard makes use of a customised instance of [RedmineUp](http://redmineup.com), using the helpdesk plugin to create new contacts for each incoming e-mail, and using time-tracking against tickets for regular reporting.

* 360Giving uses Salesforce to track the progress of publishers.

#### Prioritisation Factors

* The standard needs to report on levels of adoption
* The standard is providing a helpdesk to adopters
* There are multiple teams engaging with each adopters

#### Deprioritisation Factors

* The standard is early stage
* There is no central support offer
