Tooling in Open Data Ecosystems
===============================

Open data ecosystems usually develop a range of tools to help to advocate for more or better publication of data, to help promote use of the data, and to ease the technical processes of working with the data. 

Advocacy tools exist primarily to help convince someone of something. In open data, that’s often to help demonstrate to potential publishers why they should publish, to existing publishers why they should improve their publication, or to potential users of the data to demonstrate what the data might be able to do for them. 

Examples include 360Giving GrantNav, which as well as being a useful tool in its own right is a potent advocacy tool for publishers - they’re proud to see their data appear the next day in a well-known and well-respected tool, and the absence of an organisation from the list can be a source of mild embarrassment. 

Demonstration tools exist to stimulate innovation and to encourage people to think about what might be possible with the data. They can either offer incentives for interesting use of real existing data (which also then leads to valuable insight about the challenges of working with the real data), or by using fictitious data, as a way of demonstrating what would be possible if the data existed, or was of a certain quality. There’s some overlap with advocacy tools, although they’re usually less directly targeted to particular groups of (potential) users. 

Examples include “proof of concept” tools, data use challenges, hack-and-learn events. 

Technical tools exist to reduce the costs that anyone wanting to work with the data might incur; this is particularly valuable where a whole sector can work in the same way, or where new users can be helped to very quickly understand the possibilities of the data.

Examples include validators, aggregators, converters and visualisation tools. 

Data Infrastructure is the tools and services that are required in order for an ecosystem to continue to operate. There’s often a lot of overlap with technical tools - an instance of a technical tool that’s run for the continued benefit of the community is often part of the data infrastructure. 

Examples include registries, online conversion/validation tools and datastores.
