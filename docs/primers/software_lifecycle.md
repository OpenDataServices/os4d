Software Lifecycle
==================

There is no single, universally agreed set of terms for describing how well-developed a piece of software is. Some organisations such as GDS have defined a lifecycle, using common terms, while many are content to use terms quite loosely. 

There are two common sets of terminology, which are used interchangeably at times.

Alpha / Beta / Release Candidate / Release or Live

This set of terminology is normally used where there’s a well-defined product that’s being built - all experimentation and discovery is focussed on the details, rather than the fundamentals. The Alpha stage will normally be where the high-level architecture is defined and tested, and any particularly challenging technical problems will be identified and solutions tried. Beta will be when the software is largely ready to use, and it’s tried out by its intended users to identify if there are any parts that don’t work or are confusing. Release Candidate stage code should be ready to go, but in recognition that there are often last-minute problems that crop up, software often undergoes multiple RC rounds before being released. Any feature requests identified at beta stage or later are put aside for the next round of development, while bugs identified at RC stage may be dealt with straight away or left for later, depending on severity. 

Discovery / Prototype / MVP / Iteration

This set of terminology is usually used when there’s a well-defined problem to be solved, but multiple solutions might be acceptable. Discovery is when initial understanding of the problem is developed, and Prototypes are developed to try out specific ideas, to see if potential solutions might work. Using the learning from prototypes, an MVP can be developed to validate the solution further, which can then be iterated on to improve it (usually, using further discovery and prototyping to understand potential improvements).
