Linked Data & Semantic Markup
=============================

Linked Data has evolved from the domain of knowledge management, which studies how things that are known can be organised, discovered and relationships described. 

Semantic markup is the practice of including machine-readable information in web pages alongside the human-readable parts, so that the information can be used in linked data applications as well as by people. 

Since the mid-2000s, this “semantic web” approach has been advocated for by many leaders in web technology, most notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee.  

Semantic markup allows for high levels of automation and machine reasoning - computer systems can act in smart ways with the data that they consume. If a website presents a table of opening hours, a computer doesn’t “know” what it means - it’s just a table with some text in. With semantic markup, a computer can “know” that the text is a series of times, that those times represent when the physical place referred to by the website is open, and therefore can decide to present a warning to someone using a mapping application that the place that they’re planning a route to might be closed. 

Linked Data approaches are most commonly found in contexts that are close to knowledge management, such as academia, museums, libraries, search engines and certain AI / Machine Learning businesses. Although the technologies are well-developed, linked data approaches are relatively rare outside of these contexts, and so developers approaching Linked Data projects for the first time often have a steep learning curve. 

Schema.org is a public project (W3C-held, search-engine funded) that provides the most widely-used classification framework for the semantic web.
