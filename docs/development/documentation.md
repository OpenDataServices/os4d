# Documentation

Documentation is a vital part of any standard. In general, policy related open data standards need both:

* **Technical reference documentation**

and

* **Supporting documentation** 

These need to be approached differently, as the patterns below outline. 

## Sphinx for documentation

We make use of Sphinx to build documentation. The [sphinx-base](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/sphinx-base) project is generally used as the starting point for this. 

```eval_rst
.. todo::

    sections to add:

    * sphinx for documentation
    * example data :ref:`component-example-data`
    * designing good documentation
       * visual design

```

## Documentation patterns

```eval_rst
:ref:`patternpage-documentation`

* :ref:`pattern-ssot`
* :ref:`pattern-issue-tracker`
* :ref:`pattern-version-control-changelog`
* :ref:`pattern-governance-normative`
* :ref:`pattern-branch-release-management`
* :ref:`pattern-automated-build`
* :ref:`pattern-reproducible-builds`
* :ref:`pattern-deployment-rollback`
```
